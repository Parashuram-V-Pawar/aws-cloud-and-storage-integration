Part 1: Cloud & AWS Understanding

1. What cloud computing is:
Ans: loud computing is the delivery of computing services—like servers, storage, databases, 
   software the Internet.

   The main advantages are:
   * Scalable and Flexible: We can expand or shrink the resources based on our requirements.
   * Pay as you go model: Here we will only pay for resources we used.
   * No on-premises Hardware: We don't need to buy or manage any servers or Hardwares.

2. Differences between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS:
Ans. IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service:
    * It is like a virtual machine where we will get hardware and we only need to manage OS,
        apps and data. Provider manages the hardware.
    
    PaaS: Platform as a Service: 
    * It is a service where provider manages the OS and runtime environments and we only focus on
        deploying and running our applications on it.

    SaaS: Software as a Service:
    * Here everything is managed by the service provider and we only use the software.

3. Why AWS is used and common real-world use cases
Ans: AWS is used because of it:
    * Global infrastructure with multiple regions & availability zones
    * Scalable, reliable, secure
    * Pay-as-you-go (cost-efficient)
    * Huge ecosystem of services for compute, storage, ML, databases, networking

    Real-World Use Cases:
    * Hosting websites & applications
    * Data storage and backup 
    * Big data analytics 
    * Machine Learning & AI 
    * Streaming and content delivery

4. Purpose of EC2 and S3 in a cloud architecture
Ans: EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):
    * Provides virtual servers to run applications
    * Scalable: can launch multiple instances based on demand
    
    S3 (Simple Storage Service):
    * Provides object storage in the cloud
    * Durable and scalable for storing files (CSV, images, backups)
    
    Key difference:
    * EC2 = compute 
    * S3 = storage
