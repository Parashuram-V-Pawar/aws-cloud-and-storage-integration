Part 5: EC2 Context (Conceptual + Optional Hands-on):

1. How the same Python scripts would run on an EC2 instance
Ans: The python scripts would run similarly on an EC2 instance as they run on local machine.
    Because, EC2 is just another virtual machine it only need to have Python, Boto3 and necessary 
    dependencies installed.

2. Difference between running scripts locally vs on EC2
Ans: THe main difference is availability, scalability and security.
    Where, in local machine we need to keep it on always to make it available and on EC2 it will be always available.
    In local machine we have limited resources but on EC2 we can scale it based on requirements.
    In local machine it uses stored access keys to access resources whereas, in EC2 it uses IAM roles which provides controlled access.

3. How IAM roles can replace access keys on EC2
Ans: We can create IAM role with S3 permissions and attach it to the EC2 instance.
    Here, it doesn't require access keys as controlled access is given through IAM Roles.
